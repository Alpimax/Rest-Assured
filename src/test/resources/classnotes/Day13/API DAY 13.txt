API DAY 13 


 -- Response and Request Specification 

 -- Serenity Framework 





 ------------------------------------


   IP:7000/api/spartans
   IP:7000/api/spartans/{id}


   OLD VERSION 
   		baseURI --> IP:7000

   NEW VERSION 
   
   		baseURI --> IP 
   		port    --> 7000
   		basePath--> /api		



------------------------------------- 


REQUEST SPEC 
	- it is what we requesting from API Call
	- We can put there 

			accept()
			contentType()
			.auth().basic()
			.....
			.header()
			.pathParam()
			.queryParam()
			.and() --->syntatic sugars 



RESPONSE SPEC

	- it is what we are expecting from API call
	- We can put theres 

			contentType()
			statusCode()
			header()
			body()


-----------------------------------------------


NEW WAY --> That we are using and also we wil continue to use in future 
			It is what we learnt so far 


			- Assertions after then() --> will work as HARD ASSERT 


OLD WAY --> It is the usage to specify resposne spec after 

			expect() method 

			- Assertions after expect() --> will work as SOFT ASSERT 


-----------------------------------------------


-------------- FRAMEWORKS -----------------------

  Cucumber --> 3 layers --> UI + API + DB  
  		
  		 API --> We did create one APIStepDefs and put all steps into that class related with API 

  		 DB  --> Custom hooks are added to manage DB connection.With the help of DB_Util we are able to conection via Hooks

  		 UI  --> You did in automation class.If you wanna manage your driver based on scenario it is still doable with custom 			hooks 

  		- Can we seperate feature files ? 
  		
  			  resources 
  			  		api
  			  		   -feature1
  			  		   -feature2 
  			  		ui
  			  		   -feature1
  			  		   -feature2 
  			  	    db	
  			  	       -feature1
  			  		   -feature2    

  			  		test-data
  			  		   - userInfo.csv	

  			  		schemas
  			  		   - SingleSpartanSchema.json	   

  	    - Do we have report ? 

  	    	- YES we have it is cucumber report 

  	    			- HTML 
  	    			- JSON 


----- ONLY BACKEND FRAMEWORK ------


	JUnit5   ( API - DB ) 
		- DDT 
		    - Parameterized Tests 


    - Report 
    	- We are gonna use Serenity + Junit5 to get report in detail 



    Is Serenity framework to get only report ? 
    	- NO.It has many futures.We are gonna use and integrate to JUnit5 to get report ONLY 


    SERENITY can be used ? 
    	- Mobile 
    	- UI 
    	- DB
    	- API 	



NOTE --> BEFORE RUNNING EACH mvn verify we should use mvn clean 

		- mvn clean 
		- mvn verify 

		- mvn clean verify 


 ---- SPARTAN ADMIN TEST 

  PURE REST ASSURED

 	- We created regular API Request by using RestAssured.given() for ALL SPARTANS 

 	- We added @SerenityTest at class level to tell Serenity it is Serenity Test 

 	- After that to get report as defined into document we used MVN VERIFY 

 	- At the end of the console it shared one report link 

 	- By clicking link we able to see report 


   SERENITY REST 




    - lastResponse(); --> response --> Serenity Rest will generate after sending request and store resposne information  without saving in a variable.you need to import it from serenity 
    	-import static net.serenitybdd.rest.SerenityRest.lastResponse;


    - ValidatableResponse --> then() return Validatable response to validate our expected result 
    			
    			then().statusCode(200).....  r 	


    // ASSERTIONS IN SERENITY WAY
       
            Ensure.that --> it is method that comes from Serenity to put asssertions into Serenity Report in a good way
                             Descriptionn --> will appear into report just like a step information
                             vRes->vRes.statusCode(200) --> it will validate resposne based on provided assertions

            - It works like SOFT ASSERTION and if any steps are failing it will check all assertion and put inside Serenity REPORT 
      

Q --> should we copy paste the link and send to manager? Or take a picture. Or to add to jira is enough really I donâ€™t know
