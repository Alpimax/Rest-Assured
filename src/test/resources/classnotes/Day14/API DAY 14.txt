THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL GUIDE FOR YOU CHOOSING FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON 

YOUR BACKGROUND / KNOWLEDGE / REQUIREMENTS ETC 

DECIDE BY YOURSELF WHICH FRAMEWORK YOU ARE GONNA USE 

 - Option 1 --> Cucumber with All Layers 
 - Option 2 --> Cucumber for UI 
 		    --> Serenity for BACKEND (DB -API)
 - Option 3 --> Maybe you had background and you wanna go to market with another tool that you are comfortable with it 

 KEEP YOURSELF ALWAYS SAFE ZONE BASED ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE 		    








While you are going to market you need to choose your framework 

-------- CUCUMBER -------------

- Cucumber Framework --> You already learnt in UI 

	Q -> Which report we are using --> Cucumber Report 

	Q -> Did we learnt how to manage tags or how to run through maven or how to run with Jenkins ?  YES 

	Q -> How to do DDT in CUCUMBER ? 
		- Scenario Outline / Examples / | pipes |
		
		
 - UI --> UI Automation Class 
 - DB --> 
    Added dependeccy for different database driver 
    Added DB_Util --> which includes all necessrary methods to get data 
 		  MYSQL  -> mysql-connector-java
 		  Oracle -> ojbdc11   

 	We used custom tags to manage DB Connection each time with using @db tag over related scenario/features 
 	Hooks will do onnection and destroy coneection after each scenairo
 	
 - API 

   Added dependency which we need to run API Testign 

   		- Rest Assured
   		- JSON Schame Validator
   		- Jackson 
   		- Lombok OPTOINAL --> Boiler Plate Codes 
   		- Faker OPTIONAL  --> To create random Data
   		- SLF4J

   POJO    --> If we need to deserizalize to POJO it is still doable 
   APIUTIL --> 

   		We are able to create dynamic reqSpec or resSpec which is common for all part of request/response.In this dynamic methods we used paramters to get user credentials or status code.

   		Can we make it more dynamic ? 

   		- Of course with providing more data 
   
   Q -> Where we are gonna put steps related API ? 

   	    - You can create APIStepDefs and put here all steps
   	    - We create Response as global to share response data between step Def

  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES 

        - We created 3 different environment called as 
            qa1
            qa2
            qa3 

        - We have 2 option to provide environment with 2 way 

        FIRST WAY --> RUN FROM CUKESRUNNER 
        		- It will read environment info from configuration.properties
        		  environment=qa1
        		- Based on provided env, Environment Variables will read
        		  qa1.properties and initilize CONSTANT variables that we have into Environment Variables 
        

        SECOND -->RUN FROM MAVEN 
        	
        		- mvn test -Denvironment=qa2

        		System.getProperty("environment") will take data that you pass through maven and read qa2.properties and and initilize CONSTANT variables that we have into Environment Variables	   

        ADVANTAGE OF USING Environemnt CONSTANT Variables? 

        	- We dont need to remember name of key for specific fields 
        	- Since they are static fields we can use with classname

        	   Environment.BASEURL
        	   Environment.URL 
        	   Environment.TEACHER 


  				
-------- SERENITY  -------------


Framework for only Backend
- I used java as my programming language in my framework.
- I used maven as my built management tool. which has pom.xml file that allows me to manage my dependencies/versions easily.
- I have used JUnit5  to run and organize my test cases.
- I used Serenity to generate report and manage enviroments.
- I have restAssured library and jdbc for api and database testing.

 Database 
	- Add related driver 
		oracle -->ojdbc
		mysql  --> mysql-connector-java
		postgres --> postgres....

	- DB_Util --> to run query and get result 

	- JDBC --> It was coming from JAVA SE 

	- Connection String --> Credentials,URL  (IP , Port numbers) 	


Serenity usage.
  -I have serenity.conf file and serenity.properties file where I store my base url,...
  Database connection string and one valid user credentials for each type of user.

  serenity.conf file allows me to switch between environments easily.I have same keyname with diffenrent environments so that when I want to switch I use
  	mvn clean verify -Denvironment=...(qa2) and it runs my test cases against to env I used.
  
  If I dont specify it will use default environment that I set in serenity.conf file

  I label my classes with @SerenityTest and I set my report and root name in serenity.properties file. So that tests are recognized by report.

Junit5 Usage
  I have baseclass for my project where I use @BeforeAll and @AfterAll methods to set my base_url, db connection, and close connections and reset.

  I have used regular @Tests and @ParametrizedTests from Junit5.
  @ParameterizedTests allow me to run same testcase with different sets of data which is DDT(Data Driven Testing).

  I use @MethodSource and @CsvFileSource mostly, but I know there are like ValueSource and CsvSource also. (GIVE SOME EXAMPLE BASED ON PROJECT)

        What is  APACHI POI ? 

           - It is a dependency to read/write data from/to excel 
        
        What is Parameterized Test ? 

           - It is a that for DDT in JUNIT5 

        How we are gonna use Excel in JUNIT5 DDT ? 

           - We are gonna create one method which will feed Method Source annotated parameterized Test 

           - Create method to prepare set of data for Parameterized Test 


RestAssured usage
  I use Serenity version of restassured library where I have same methods in gherkin format.Gherkin allow me type readable test cases for non-technical people.If the person knows api they can easliy understand my test cases.

  Serenity way is allowing me to get request and response in the report.I also use Ensure.that() type of verification to log each assertion that I make, to see in the report.

  I use Hamcrest matchers inside the my assertion,I use pojo classes and java maps mostly to store and send request and json body.

  I have utility classes for my api and database.
  I have used database util class to create and close connection, it gets information from my serenituy.conf file and switch env dynamically. I also have ready methods to execute queries and store them the format I like,
    example: list of maps to use inputs with @MethodSource

  I also have ApiUtils we I created methods for reusable requests like generating token for different usertype. I also have some Response and RequestSpecification saved where I already defined repeated given and then sesssion.
    Example for request: Accept,content-type,token for different user,log.




If you wanna try to run Serenity Project in JENKINS too.It is totally optional and max 5 min it will take to set up 


	# How to Get Report for Serenity after Jenkins Test Execution

	1. Manage Jenkins --> Manage Plugins --> Available

	2. Install ```Tuchydides Test Reports```  plugin and Restart Jenkins

	3. Create new Jenkins Job for Serenity Project

	4. Build--> Invoke Top Level Maven Targets -->``` mvn clean verify -Dtest=ClassName -Denvironment=library2 ```

	5. Post Build Action --> ``` Publish Tuchydides Test Reports ```

	6. Report path --> ``` target/site/serenity ```

	7. Build Jenkins Job

	8. Click over Jenkins Job

	9. Click ```Tuchydides Test Reports ``` to see ```Serenity Report```


**Rest is talking about API and DB Testing in this framework.**
NOTE:we only know basics of serenity, you are ready to learn more. keep yourself in safe zone.


--------------- HOW TO PASS any variable through MAVEN ---------------------

- System.getProperty("user.dir") --> it will give framework path from your local 


- System.getProperty("variable") --> it will read data that you provide from maven with -D keyword 

	- D is using to define --> System property 

	- Denvironment=qa2 --> it will define a system variable callaed as environment with the value qa2 

	- If we use anywhere in framework 

		System.getProperty("environment") --> it will catch your calue and use it 


	mvn test -Denvironment=qa2 -Dbrowser=firefox 


		--> ENVIRONMENT

        String environment = System.getProperty("environment") != null ? environment = System.getProperty("environment") : ConfigurationReader.getProperty("environment");

        environment=qa2

        --> DRIVER
        String browser = System.getProperty("browser") != null ? 
        browser = System.getProperty("browser") : ConfigurationReader.getProperty("browser");

        browser=firefox 


Can we add more system variable ? 
 - YES 

	mvn test -Denvironment=qa2 -Dbrowser=firefox -Dteacher_email=white@cydeo.com

	--> LOGIN 
        String teacher_email = System.getProperty("teacher_email") != null ? 
        teacher_email = System.getProperty("teacher_email") : Environment.TEACHER_EMAIL;



--- REPORT -------

    1- Jenkins --> When you run your suite from Jenkins with the help of plugins(Jira,TestRail ...) you can put your result into 
                Jira,Testrail... automatically.

    2- After execution --> Take your screenshot put as evidence into your tool (Jira.....) or you can import your report as well
                
    3- You can set email conf to get report after executions.
